# Carlos-Challenge-6-Weather-Dashboard

## The purpose of this project is to create a weather app that retrieves weather data using a weather API for any location that the user enters. The app was designed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and with some implementation of the Open Weather API. Unfortunately I've been having trouble how to implement the api properly as wellas the rest of the javascript. But hopefully I can put some more into the Javascript coding when I havemore time.
